            Memed.fun v4.3 introduces a 7-day fair launch window with an early
            launch option, ensuring both inclusivity and momentum. The model is
            built around meme token staking, direct battle rewards, and a
            transparent bonding curve, maximizing community participation and
            long-term value. All rewards are earned, not airdropped, and all
            token flows are on-chain and auditableâ€”delivering a fair, fast, and
            sustainable meme coin platform for the next wave of Web3 users.

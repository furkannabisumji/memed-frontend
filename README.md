## What's the Hype?

Imagine if your favorite meme creator could:

* Mint their own token
* Battle other creators' tokens
* Reward their community for engagement
* Build a staking ecosystem

That's Memed.Fun ‚Äî a playground where social influence meets token economics.

## How It Works

### 1. Create Your Meme Token

* Connect your Lens handle
* Design your token (name, ticker, description, meme image)
* Deploy ERC-20 contract
* Profile becomes the token's identity
* Start collecting followers and buyers

### 2. Battle System

* Challenge other creators via Lens thread
* 24-hour battle window
* Metrics: Follows, Likes, Mirrors, Comments, Stake Weight
* Winner determined via smart contract snapshot
* Winning meme gains heat score, token emission boost, visibility

### 3. Staking & Rewards

* Anyone can stake tokens behind a meme (showing belief)
* Boost meme heat score based on staked amount
* Stakers earn a share of:

  * Meme's battle wins
  * Engagement rewards
* Rewards claimed via smart contract

### 4. Engagement Rewards

* Lens engagement tracked using Lens API and The Graph
* Top engagers per meme get rewards
* Engagement metrics weighted:

  * Mirror > Comment > Like
* Battle wins
* Rewards claimed via merkle tree
